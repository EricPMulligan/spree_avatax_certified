SpreeAvataxCertified is the *only* [officially certified Avatax solution](http://www.avalara.com/avalara-certified/) that integrates with SpreeCommerce.  With this extension you can add instantaneous sales tax decisions to your store.

From Avalara's own explanation of the certification program:

> Relax. It’s certified.
>
> Our “Certified for AvaTax” Program features integrations that perform at the highest level, providing the best possible customer experience.

> Avalara’s partners who have created certified integrations for AvaTax have demonstrated that those integrations contain elements which are essential to providing customers with easy-to-use software that gives accurate sales tax calculations. The certification criteria used to demonstrate these elements are based on Avalara’s years of experience integrating into ERP, ecommerce and point-of-sale applications.

Make sure you have your tax rates set up for each tax category you have available on your site. If you use clothing, electronics, and shipping, there should be a tax rate for each of those.
